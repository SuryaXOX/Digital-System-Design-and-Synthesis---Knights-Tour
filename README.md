The image above is a high level view of the project I was working on. It involves a Knight traversing through a chessboard. Move Commands can be given through a BLE module like a tab or a phone. The inertial interface gets the reading from the gyro, which is then used by the command processor to set the PID control. The PID sets the motor drive of the robot. The left, center and right IR sensors help keep the robot in between the guardrails, within a square.
